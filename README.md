Markdown Previewer with React.js

Another project done for freeCodeCamp certificate. And I can't say I am really satisfied with this one!
Firstly, I finished "react part" of the project in 15 minutes! What I did for next three, four hours was reading 
documentations on marked library! That part was the one I am pissed at! Why have all those lessons introducing
various preprocessors, libraries, frameworks and what not, and then give assignment in which we have to 
use another library you did not explain nor have lesson in curriculum?!?!?!??!?!

For further use, this is docs url: https://github.github.com/gfm/#images
And this is url of the image: https://unsplash.com/photos/vm2cwMEiUFA (artist: Andre Hunter).

Gonna go and upload this project to Codepen and then submit that link on freecodecamp page.

See ya tomorrow, and let's hope third fcc project does not have any new
libraries to learn!   -.-
